"""
This example shows how to create a glow around a model node using the SlicerLayerDisplayableManager extension.

It goes over the following concepts:
    - Creates a unique display pipeline to set attach a VTK glow pass to a renderer
    - Creates one glow display pipeline per 3D view for each created model nodes in the scene
    - Register the pipeline creation mechanism

Usage:
    This example is implemented as a scripted module and can be added as such to Slicer.
    Once added, loading new model nodes will set their glow pass automatically.

    To add a new creator to the factory, we use a vtkMRMLLayerDMPipelineScriptedCreator instance and set a callback
    to our custom tryCreate function.

    This function will iterate on the pipelines we want to create and create it when applicable.

    Note: Scene lifecycle are managed by the LayerDM library. If the view is newly created, its pipeline manager will
        iterate over all the nodes in the scene to check if pipelines need to be created.

        Similarly, when loading a scene, clearing a scene, the pipelines will be handled accordingly.
